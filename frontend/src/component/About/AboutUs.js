          <h2>What is Dead Stock?</h2>
          <p>
            Dead stock refers to merchandise that remains unsold and unused for an extended period, tying up valuable
            resources and warehouse space for retailers and manufacturers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Managing dead stock is a significant challenge for businesses, as it represents lost revenue and wasted
            investment. It can also lead to increased storage costs, reduced cash flow, and diminished profitability.
          </p>
